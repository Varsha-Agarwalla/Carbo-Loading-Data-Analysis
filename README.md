What am I trying to do?

I am looking at the carbo-loading household level transactions over a period of two years from four categories- Pasta, Pasta Sauce, Syrup, and Pancake Mix.

Based on the richness of the data, I want to know:

- Are complementary products bought together?

- if product sales depend on the display?

How to go about this?

- I will look at the household-week level transactions for the product categories- pasta and pasta sauce and see if I can identify a pattern in the items bought across the weeks.

- I will slice the data at product, week, store, display_desc, and sales level. Then I will see the trend for each product to see if we observe any pattern in sales based on the location of temporary in-store.

How will this be useful?

- This analysis will help retailer design marketing campaigns for the complementary products.

- The product display will help understand how customers make a decision and how display causes impact on the choice a customer makes.
